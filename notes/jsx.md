JSX
---

JSX is the templating syntax used by React.

The equivalent of this in Vue is the <template> tag from Vue components.

JSX seems to allow more things than <template> but also seem to need a lot more of care concerning the readability of the code.

Examples
---

~~~~javascript
const name = 'Josh Perez';

const element = <h1>Hello, {name}</h1>;

const elementUpperCase = <h1>Hello, {name.toUpperCase()}</h1>;
~~~~

You can put any valid JavaScript expression inside the curly braces in JSX.

~~~~javascript
function getGreeting(user) {
  if (user) {
    return <h1>Hello, {formatName(user)}!</h1>;
  }
  return <h1>Hello, Stranger.</h1>;
}
~~~~

JSX is an expression too

~~~~javascript
const element = <div tabIndex="0"></div>;

const element = <img src={user.avatarUrl}></img>;
~~~~

Both quotes and curly braces works for specifying attributes in JSX, but can't be used in the same attribute.

Since JSX is closer to JavaScript than to <template> or HTML, the usage of camelCase is highly recommended concerning attributes.

"class" becomes className.

"tabindex" becomes tabIndex.

This avoids conflicts with JavaScript keywords such as "class".

~~~~javascript
const element = <img src={user.avatarUrl} />;

const element = (
  <div>
    <h1>Hello!</h1>
    <h2>Good to see you here.</h2>
  </div>
);
~~~~

JSX tags can self-close, but can also contain childrens, like regular HTML tags.

~~~~javascript
const element = (
  <h1 className="greeting">
    Hello, world!
  </h1>
);
const element = React.createElement(
  'h1',
  {className: 'greeting'},
  'Hello, world!'
);
~~~~

These are identical.

JSX is compiled down to React.createElement() calls.

Quotes
---

> React embraces the fact that rendering logic is inherently coupled with other UI logic: how events are handled, how the state changes over time, and how the data is prepared for display.

> After compilation, JSX expressions become regular JavaScript function calls and evaluate to JavaScript objects.

> By default, React DOM escapes any values embedded in JSX before rendering them. Thus it ensures that you can never inject anything thatâ€™s not explicitly written in your application. Everything is converted to a string before being rendered. This helps prevent XSS (cross-site-scripting) attacks.
 
> Babel compiles JSX down to React.createElement() calls.
